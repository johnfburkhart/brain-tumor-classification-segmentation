Repository for final project in NCSU graduate machine learning course. We used data from kaggle to perform binary classification and semantic segmentation on a set of tumorous and non-tumorous MRIs. The write-up can be found in this repository. 

I did all of the work for image processing and binary classification, which I wrote about in the write-up. My partners handled the semantic segmentation task and wrote about their results in the corresponding sections of the manuscript.
